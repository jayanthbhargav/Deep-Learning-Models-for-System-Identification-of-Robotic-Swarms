--------Simulation Parameters--------- 
MAX_ITER = 1000000 # total number of iterations to simulate
STEP_SIZE = 0.0001 # each step in Euler's method
AGENT_COUNT = 32
SAMPLING_RATE = 1000 # This means there are 1000 data points
COUPLING_STRENGTH = 0.25

-------------Description--------------
- This simulates a swarm of 32 self-propelled agents.
- It's a second order system with white gaussian noise ~ N(0,1)
- No time lag
- The swarm eventually forms Ring stability
- This file has 1000 rows - 1000 steps sampled from the swarm simulation
- This file has 64 columns - column i and i+1 (where i is even and indexing from 0) are the tuples (xi, yi) and (v_xi, v_yi), position and velocity values of the i/2th agent
